            "[18:42.960 --> 18:44.260]  and who is white?\n",
            "[18:44.560 --> 18:46.440]  Well, the current legislation\n",

            "[18:49.660 --> 18:52.760]  said that to avoid any sort of prejudice\n",

            "[18:54.460 --> 18:55.460]  People would come and say,\n",

            "[18:59.140 --> 19:01.960]  But then there were many accusations of fraud,\n",
            "[19:02.160 --> 19:05.120]  especially in the most difficult courses like medicine.\n",
            "[19:05.980 --> 19:09.000]  So different universities have set up committees\n",
            "[19:09.000 --> 19:12.280]  to verify that, to check if they agreed or not.\n",
            "[19:12.700 --> 19:14.440]  And it's still not in the law,\n",
            "[19:14.520 --> 19:16.200]  but that's what most universities do.\n",
            "[19:16.440 --> 19:17.960]  If someone declared that they are black\n",
            "[19:17.960 --> 19:19.540]  or they're indigenous, they will check.\n",
            "[19:19.880 --> 19:22.660]  So why has President Lula said that this programme\n",
            "[19:22.660 --> 19:24.860]  needs to be extended by fourfold?\n",
            "[19:25.180 --> 19:28.060]  Well, what you have in Brazil is a situation\n",
            "[19:28.060 --> 19:31.220]  where Brazil, many people won't know,\n",
            "[19:31.320 --> 19:34.780]  has the second biggest black population in the world\n",
            "[19:34.780 --> 19:35.960]  after Nigeria.\n",
            "[19:36.300 --> 19:39.060]  It was the last country in the world to free slaves.\n",
            "[19:39.480 --> 19:43.060]  So there's a lot of, let's say, historical legacy\n",
            "[19:43.060 --> 19:44.800]  and a history of discrimination\n",
            "[19:44.800 --> 19:46.320]  where most...\n",
            "[19:46.440 --> 19:46.860]  I would say that most of the people,\n",
            "[19:47.300 --> 19:49.900]  I would say that most of the black people,\n",
            "[19:49.940 --> 19:51.160]  people of African origin,\n",
            "[19:51.360 --> 19:52.380]  many of them are mixed,\n",
            "[19:52.580 --> 19:54.260]  are the poorest.\n",
            "[19:54.620 --> 19:57.220]  But the criticism to this legislation\n",
            "[19:57.220 --> 19:59.840]  is that, or to quote a system in Brazil,\n",
            "[19:59.920 --> 20:02.200]  is that Brazil is a racially diverse country.\n",
            "[20:02.340 --> 20:03.760]  You have people in the same family\n",
            "[20:03.760 --> 20:06.060]  who will look black or who look white,\n",
            "[20:06.080 --> 20:06.840]  or mixed race.\n",
            "[20:07.020 --> 20:08.940]  So it's not the same scenario as you had\n",
            "[20:08.940 --> 20:12.240]  in the United States or, let's say, in South Africa.\n",
            "[20:12.500 --> 20:14.020]  So that's one of the criticisms.\n",
            "[20:14.500 --> 20:16.280]  But what President Lula said,\n",
            "[20:16.440 --> 20:18.780]  is we have been doing what we can\n",
            "[20:18.780 --> 20:21.900]  to reduce social inequality and racism.\n",
            "[20:21.980 --> 20:23.640]  And that's a way of doing it.\n",
            "[20:23.760 --> 20:26.200]  The current legislation has managed\n",
            "[20:26.200 --> 20:28.700]  to get many, many people into university\n",
            "[20:28.700 --> 20:30.500]  and people who did well\n",
            "[20:30.500 --> 20:33.040]  who wouldn't have gone into university without it.\n",
            "[20:33.240 --> 20:34.560]  That was Leonardo Rocha.\n",

            "[20:46.440 --> 20:47.680]  Some resident recorded a tremor\n",

            "[21:01.200 --> 21:02.900]  There's still a lot of uncertainty\n",
            "[21:02.900 --> 21:04.260]  regarding an eruption.\n",
            "[21:04.460 --> 21:05.740]  There is a slight possibility\n",
            "[21:05.740 --> 21:07.000]  that there won't be one,\n",
            "[21:07.100 --> 21:09.800]  but they say that the odds are much higher\n",
            "[21:09.800 --> 21:11.500]  on that there will be an eruption,\n",
            "[21:11.620 --> 21:14.400]  whether it'll happen in hours, in days or in weeks.\n",
            "[21:14.500 --> 21:15.820]  We don't know at this point.\n",
            "[21:16.440 --> 21:17.580]  But what has happened today\n",
            "[21:17.580 --> 21:19.040]  and which is a new development\n",
            "[21:19.040 --> 21:20.620]  is that people have been allowed\n",
            "[21:20.620 --> 21:23.520]  to come into the town in small groups,\n",
            "[21:23.700 --> 21:25.100]  one person per home,\n",
            "[21:25.740 --> 21:27.400]  to get their valuables.\n",
            "[21:27.520 --> 21:29.700]  And they get about five minutes\n",
            "[21:29.700 --> 21:32.240]  to go into the house and get what they need.\n",
            "[21:32.420 --> 21:34.480]  The town you're talking about, Grindavik,\n",
            "[21:34.520 --> 21:37.720]  it's not that far from the main airport,\n",
            "[21:38.060 --> 21:39.540]  Grindavik International Airport.\n",
            "[21:39.740 --> 21:41.060]  I mean, are people braced\n",
            "[21:41.060 --> 21:43.440]  for having to close the airport for some period?\n",
            "[21:43.900 --> 21:45.160]  Not at this point.\n",
            "[21:45.340 --> 21:46.240]  We've had...\n",
            "[21:46.240 --> 21:47.880]  We've had three eruptions in this area\n",
            "[21:47.880 --> 21:49.060]  in the last three years,\n",
            "[21:49.220 --> 21:51.100]  but they haven't been in the town.\n",
            "[21:51.220 --> 21:52.620]  So they've been in the vicinity.\n",
            "[21:53.140 --> 21:54.940]  And in none of those cases,\n",
            "[21:55.040 --> 21:57.400]  the airport has had to close or had any problems.\n",
            "[21:57.580 --> 21:59.600]  The risk is that if it goes out to sea,\n",
            "[21:59.800 --> 22:01.260]  it could be a little bit different\n",
            "[22:01.260 --> 22:03.920]  because if the lava mixes with seawater,\n",
            "[22:04.020 --> 22:07.880]  then we could be looking at some ash and steam and things.\n",
            "[22:08.000 --> 22:08.860]  But at this moment,\n",
            "[22:09.000 --> 22:10.560]  there's nothing to worry about there.\n",
            "[22:10.760 --> 22:12.200]  And just to add,\n",
            "[22:12.420 --> 22:15.220]  it is completely safe at the moment to travel to Iceland.\n",
            "[22:15.220 --> 22:18.020]  So if you have travel plans to come to Iceland,\n",
            "[22:18.220 --> 22:20.920]  I'm sorry, you're not going to be able to go to the Blue Lagoon,\n",
            "[22:20.980 --> 22:22.660]  but everything else is fine.\n",
            "[22:22.800 --> 22:25.180]  People can travel from the airport to the city\n",
            "[22:25.180 --> 22:26.700]  and then out around the country.\n",
            "[22:26.980 --> 22:30.000]  So there's no need to worry about that at this moment.\n",
            "[22:30.300 --> 22:31.960]  What is happening to the people,\n",
            "[22:32.060 --> 22:33.360]  the citizens of Grindavik,\n",
            "[22:33.380 --> 22:35.020]  who have evacuated their town?\n",

            "[22:36.000 --> 22:37.860]  Is there a kind of a protocol\n",
            "[22:37.860 --> 22:40.140]  for what happens when you have to evacuate somewhere?\n",
            "[22:40.420 --> 22:42.560]  Well, we're a very small nation.\n",
            "[22:42.640 --> 22:44.580]  And in times like this,\n",
            "[22:44.580 --> 22:45.700]  people come together.\n",
            "[22:45.940 --> 22:47.880]  So what happened on Saturday\n",
            "[22:47.880 --> 22:50.240]  when they had to evacuate in the middle of the night?\n",
            "[22:50.580 --> 22:52.500]  Most of the people could go\n",
            "[22:52.500 --> 22:53.960]  and stay with friends and relatives.\n",
            "[22:54.260 --> 22:57.720]  There is a population of immigrants in the town,\n",
            "[22:57.840 --> 22:59.860]  people from Poland and other countries\n",
            "[22:59.860 --> 23:03.620]  that don't have this network of family and friends in the country.\n",
            "[23:03.900 --> 23:06.920]  And some of these people had to go to shelters.\n",
            "[23:07.100 --> 23:09.020]  And then there's all these practical things\n",
            "[23:09.020 --> 23:10.320]  they're trying to figure out now.\n",
            "[23:10.520 --> 23:12.040]  Where do the kids go to school?\n",
